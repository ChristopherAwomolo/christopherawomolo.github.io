                        In this blog, I’ll share how I built the software side of a Rubik's cube-solving robot. I'll focus on three main aspects: (1) creating a graphical user interface (GUI) of the cube using Python and Qt5, (2) implementing a color detection algorithm using decision trees to identify the cube's color patterns, and (3) writing scripts to extract cube regions and categorize the cube's colors. This project combines visual programming with machine learning and image processing, providing an insightful look into developing software for physical robotics.

                    <p>This project is part of a broader system for solving a Rubik's cube robotically. The software side primarily includes visual representation, color recognition, and image processing:

                        GUI: A user interface to visualize the cube in both 2D (a net or flattened view) and 3D (an interactive, rotatable OpenGL view).
                        Color Detection: An algorithm that identifies the six colors of the cube from webcam images using decision trees, which were trained using HSV color space data.
                        Region Extraction and Categorization: Scripts to detect the regions of interest on the cube (the 9 stickers per face) and categorize the colors correctly to feed into the solving algorithm.</p>

                            <p>To make sure that the state of the Rubik's cube could be easily understood and solved by the robot, I created a Python-based GUI, specifically using the Python Qt5 library. 
                                This library was specifically chosen due to its lightweight yet very customisable design, which also included a PyOpenGL widget in which I used to render an interactable
