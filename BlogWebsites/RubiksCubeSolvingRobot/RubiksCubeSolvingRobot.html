                        In this blog, I’ll share how I built the software side of a Rubik's cube-solving robot. I'll focus on three main aspects: (1) creating a graphical user interface (GUI) of the cube using Python and Qt5, (2) implementing a color detection algorithm using decision trees to identify the cube's color patterns, and (3) writing scripts to extract cube regions and categorize the cube's colors. This project combines visual programming with machine learning and image processing, providing an insightful look into developing software for physical robotics.

                    <p>This project is part of a broader system for solving a Rubik's cube robotically. The software side primarily includes visual representation, color recognition, and image processing:

                        GUI: A user interface to visualize the cube in both 2D (a net or flattened view) and 3D (an interactive, rotatable OpenGL view).
                        Color Detection: An algorithm that identifies the six colors of the cube from webcam images using decision trees, which were trained using HSV color space data.
                        Region Extraction and Categorization: Scripts to detect the regions of interest on the cube (the 9 stickers per face) and categorize the colors correctly to feed into the solving algorithm.</p>

                    <h3>Parts List</h3>
                    <p>Firstly, I would like to split the project into two parts: Hardware and Software, which is important in maintaining a clear overview of the project</p>

                            <h5>Colour Detection Algorithm</h5> 
                            <p>The colour detection algorithm was made by using decision trees utilising the libraries TensorFlow and PyTorch. The hsv values were used as a metric to classify the different colours.
                            </p>
                            <h3>GUI</h3>
                            <h5>Library Used</h5> 
                            <p>The library used in this application was Python's Qt5 library.
                                This library was specifically chosen due to its lightweight yet very customisable design, which also included a PyOpenGL widget in which I used to render an interactable 
                                3d version of the cube, as well as Widgets in which I could initialise the camera using opencv and display on the GUI. 
                            </p>
                            <h5>Displaying the net of the Cube</h5> 
                            <p>Displaying the net of the cube, or rather the colours for the net of the cube was rather simple. I created a label for each square of the rubiks cube, and extracted the values 
                                of the specific cube piece (for all cube piece), when given a dictionary containing the positions of each of the facets (keys) and each colour of the facets (values).
                            </p>
                            <h5>Displaying and animating the cube</h5> 
                            <p>Displaying and animating the cube was done using PyOpenGL and Pygame in conjunction with PyQt5's OpenGLWidget. The cube animates when any of the keys: U, R, L, F, B, D (corresponding
                                to the faces on the Rubik's cube) are pressed. Using this logic, each individual string of the solved solution was passed into the animating function so that the cube could animate 
                                the solve. 
                            </p>
                            <h5>Solving the cube</h5> 
                            <p>Solving the cube was quite easy, the kociemba libary was used. In future, I plan to add a more efficient algorithm such that the cube can be solved in a quicker amount of time.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Showing the steps of the Rubik's Cube</h5> 
                            <p>I had added an 'additional steps' button on the GUI such that the user could go through all of the steps on the rubiks cube. This was done by getting the kociemba solved string
                                and expanding the solved string e.g. "U F2 D R2 B' F' L2" -> "U F F D R R B' F' L L". This provided a more thorough detail into the steps made to solve the rubiks cube. To track the current step 
                                of the cube, I initialised two variables: current_step and previous_step, with debouncing so that the animation does not freeze and play twice when pressing multiple buttons.
                                There was an issue when skipping steps e.g. if I wanted to go from step 6 to 19 and vice versa, the first was solved by taking the difference in steps between the previous_step 
                                and the current step and animating, whereas the latter required a more complex solution. To go back in steps, like going from 19 to 6, the original solved string had to be 
                                converted into a list and then reversed, before taking the Prime (") of the entire list. Using the previous example, the reversed list would be "L L F' B' R R D F F U", and the primed
                                list would result in "L' L' F B R' R' D' F' F' U'". Notice how taking the prime of a prime results in the original step (similar to how complements work in maths).
